# Devops-Project_IBM
This project sets up an automated CI/CD pipeline using Git, Jenkins, and Docker. Code pushed to Git triggers Jenkins to build, test, and create a Docker image, which is then pushed to Docker Hub and deployed. It simplifies software delivery by automating the build and deployment process.
